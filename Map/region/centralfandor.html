<div class="imagedescription">Central Fandor is the southern land of the Kingdom of Fandor. The region is situated at the heart of the continent and it is known for its huge ravines and its large farmlands to the north. The region is surrounded by the <a href="metzan.html">Metzan Forest</a> to the south and the west, the <a href="tontarrian.html">Tontarrian Mountains to the East and the <a href="wasteland.html">Wasteland</a> and <a href="deadforest.html">Dead Forest</a> to the North-East. If you were to follow the river down its path, you would reach <a href="northernfandor.html">Northern Fandor</a> to the North-West.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>Central Fandor is part of the Kingdom of Fandor, the kingdom is contained mostly along the Feldin river that runs from the <a href="tontarrian.html">Tontarrian Mountains</a> through the continent to the Northern Ocean. Most major cities of the Kingdom of Fandor are located on that river. Central Fandor is most known to have the fortress city of <a href="landmark/inzan.html">Inzan. Inzan</a> is renowed to be an unsiegeable city and it is a sign of power on the entire continent.</br>
</br>
The Kingdom of Fandor also has three other village in Central Fandor, namely: <a href="landmark/rivercoast.html">Rivercoast</a>, a trade village; <a href="landmark/twirivea.html">Twirivea</a>, a glamourous town where a lot of rich and important people of the kingdom have retreats; <a href="landmark/buletwost.html">Buletwost</a>, a remote lumber city overrun by outlaws.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
Most of the North portion of Central Fandor is a huge fertile farmland. From farm to ranch, the land is mostly flat and cultivated by peasants. There are no major cities, only houses here and there of the local peasant who work the land.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
Central Fandor is characterized by its huge mountain and the Feldin river that runs through it. It is quite temperate and the part of the land which is not too mountaineous is usually really fertile. The land is very difficult to naviguate around the Inzan fortress and it is impossible to cross the river there unless you go through the gigantic drawbridge that surround the city. This make Inzan a real fortress that stood for ages without anyone able to conquer it.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
There are very few monsters and wildlife in the region. The most danger there is to be are local bandits, but even then the Kingdom of Fandor has guards that protect the main roads, making it one of the safest area on the continent.
