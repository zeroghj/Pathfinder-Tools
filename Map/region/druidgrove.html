<div class="imagedescription">The Druid's Grove is a less visited part of the Continent, there are about two reason to go there: 1. You want to reach the Highlands from Northern Fandor or 2. You are a druid. </br>
</br>
Cities: </br>There are two "cities" in the region, the first one is <a href="landmark/elfan.html">Elfan</a>, an elven city centered around religion. The other "city" is the Druid's Cave, it is a secret underground Den where the Druid of the continent go to meet every 5 years. It is impossible to enter unless you are a druid yourself, so very little is known about this place.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
There are two other landmark in the region, one is an Old Windmill that has been abandonned for ages but is now overrun by Hobgoblins. Then there is the Old Mausoleum. This large mausoleum holds the remains of past King of Fandor and important Noble Families.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
The northern portion of Druid's Grove is large grasslands, they are rather windy with very little tall vegetation. The main attraction of the region is the Druid's Grove, it has very old and tall trees that have been there for milleniums. It is said that those who are atune to nature can listen to the trees talk. </br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
The Druid's Grove Forest is not dangerous in term of wildlife, everything living in it is in perfect harmony, just make sure the local elf allow you to walk in the wood though. The Grassland to the north is much more dangerous, Hobgoblins wander the land allong with Troll and other savage humanoids.
