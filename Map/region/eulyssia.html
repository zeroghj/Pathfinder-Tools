<div class="imagedescription">Eulyssia is a region ruled by the Kingdom of Eulice, one of the three human kingdoms. Eulyssia Lake is a region surrounding the huge fresh-water lake called Eulyssia.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>Most cities within the region are part of the Kingdom of Eulice, the Kingdom is the most secluded of the three kingdom, it has no access to the Ocean for travel and the only road connecting it to the outside passes through Mt.Doom, making it very difficult to reach the Kingdom with an army. <a href="landmark/eulice.html">Eulice</a> is the Capital of the Kingdom, it is the largest capital city on the continent and a work of wonder. The second largest city of the kingdom is <a href="landmark/manastoria.html">Manastoria</a>, it stands on magical ground. <a href="landmark/filiyas.html">Filiyas</a> is "the bridge city", mostly known for the huge magical bridge in the city.</br>
</br>
The Kingdom of Eulice also has countless smaller village in the region, the most important and notable being: Village of Sul, a village built around a shrine for the Maiden of the Lake; the Village of Mandroga, the central village that support the many orange and apple orchard of the region; the village of Illion, this village is one of thinkering and engineering, its population is usually half human and half gnomes; finally the village of Vindici, A town that deal with packaging and shipping the rare flowers that grow in the region.</br>
</br>
While everything named so far had been human settlement part of the Kingdom of Eulice, there is one major Orc Stronghold in southern Eulyssia. <a href="landmark/konkrash.html">Stronghold Konkrash</a> is the largest Orc setlement on the continent and it has always been one of the greatest enemy of the kingdom. The Orcs are organized and bring terror to the southern part of the region. Despite long military campaign, the Kingdom of Eulice was never able to get rid of them.
</br>
Landmark:</br>
Other than the Lake itself, the only notable landmark would be the War plains, a region in southern Eulyssia where Orc and Humans have been fighting one another for centuries. The land which used to be fertile is now but a pile of rough dirt and corpses.
</br>
Environment:</br>
Eulyssia is very temperate, it is a nice place to live and be. It rarely rains, instead it is more habitual to see a fog come down from the Golden Mountains and it irrigate the fields this way.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
While there are some wildlife in the region, they are usually pretty weak and common one like bees, coyote and the like. The wildlife is really not that wild in the region.
