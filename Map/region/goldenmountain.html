<div class="imagedescription">The Golden Mountains is a really dry region of the continent where little can survive. It is a deadly and hot desert with a nearby chain of mountains. The  name Golden Mountains comes from the fact that the mountains are said to be filled with Gold. The region is otherwise really hostile and a deathtrap, but the prospect of richess tempt many individuals to wander this land.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>Only a single city exist in the Golden Mountains, it is called <a href="landmark/dustdream.html">Dustdream</a> and it lies on the coast. The city is really multicultural and the only other thing remotely colonized in the area is a small mining camp currently operated in the mountains. There exists a road in between the two and those three things are about everything civilized in this cruel desert.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
The only landmark other than the vast desert, is a gigantic Dragon Nest that spawn about half the Golden Mountain in its northern region. No one was able to approach it enough to pinpoint the exact location of the center of the nest, and it is not recommended to try and find out.</br>
Another rumored landmark is a gigantic temple lost somewhere in the desert. Although there is no proof of its existence.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
The Golden Mountains themselves are tall rocky mountains that are rumored to be filled with gold, silver and different magical gems. On the outside though, most of the Golden Mountains region is desert, there is very few precipitation and you can die of dehydration really quickly under the intense sun. You need be prepared to travel through this land because if the wildlife won't kill you, the environment itself will. The Northern region of the Golden Mountains is composed of grassland and forest and is much more habitable. It is very similar to Northern Fandor in term of temperature.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
Between the Dragon Nest that spawn the mountains, to the Kobold infested mines or the giant scorpions that roam the deserts, The Golden Mountains is a very dangerous region to wander. The desert is actually the safest region when in comes to wildlife, the most dangerous place to be is the more habitable northern grassland region. This region is a hunting ground for the dragons and sailor who sails nearby tell tales of Giant walking the land there. No one has dared venture in those lands for centuries, and those who were foolish enough to do so have given their life for it.
