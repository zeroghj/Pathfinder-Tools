<h2 class="title">City of Branton</h2>
<div class="description">Branton is a human city that is not part of any kingdom, it is not known where the humans of the city originate from, but they are physically very different than other humans. They have dark skin, broad shoulder, they usually stand half a meter higher than other humans and have the muscle of an Ape. They are refered to as Barbarian by the other civilizations and it is true that they are not very good at engineering or magic and use old technologies and method to survive, but they are far from brutes. They are usually welcoming of stranger, but they can be easily offended if you did not understand and follow their rituals and culture. The city does not have any commerce as the Barbarian do not believe in currency and trade and instead share their ressources.
