<h2 class="title">Buletwost</h2>
<div class="description">Buletwost used to be a lumber town at the outskirt of Central Fandor. Over the years though, it has become ever more chaotic and the town now stand in complete contrast to the rest of the Kingdom of Fandor. Outlaws and Bandit operate in the city and the Kingdom of Fandor have had difficulty putting an end to the high profile crime that happens in the town. People now rarely go to the city and anyone who travels there is assumed to be in on some kind of illegal activities.
