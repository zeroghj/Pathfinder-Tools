<h2 class="title">The Demon Portal</h2>
<div class="description">This portal is over 40 meters tall and 80 meters wide. It is a state of the art magical device that was created by one of the most powerful wizard of his time. The portal links this world to the demon realm, it allows for easy passage without restriction, as long as you can fit through the gate. It is no longer active, it has been disabled ages ago, but there are always some imp and other lesser demons trying to repair it and make it work again to summon forth their master and destruction. There is obviously no chance of that happening, only a powerful magic user could stand a chance at providing the necessary mana and the Great Wizard Academy takes care of overlooking the portal in case someone tried to reactivate it.
