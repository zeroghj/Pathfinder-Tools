<h2 class="title">City of Dustdream</h2>
<div class="description">Dustdream is a harbor town that lives only from the adventurers and entrepreneur who wish to mine in the region. All the food and goods have to be imported since the town itself cannot produce anything, there is a single road that leaves Dustdream towards the mountain and no other way to reach the city. The ships that comes to this town are the only way in and out of the Golden Mountains and the only reason the city exists in the first place.</br>
The city is hot, filthy, but it remains the best place to stay while in this deadly desert.
