<h2 class="title">Elfan</h2>
<div class="description">Elfan is a shrine-city, the elf living there are very diffirent than the other elven culture on the continent. They are a tribe of warrior priest who defend the Druid's Grove and they take their job very seriously. The City looks more like a huge monastery than a traditional city and there is no commerce or trade to be done here. Only a select few people are allowed to enter the city and the forest, doing so without permission will aggravate the Elfs and you don't want them to be angry at you, they are born warriors that have been trained in the art of combat.
