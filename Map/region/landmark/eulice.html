<div class="description">Eulice is said to be the most beautiful city in the world. It is rich and prosperous, the architecture is out of this world with every building made of marble and stone. Some rare plants and tree have been planted to make of the city a living garden and there are even waterfall coming from the top of the tallest buildings. Eulice seems to be a real Utopia for any travelers and you would be hard pressed to see anything wrong with it on the surface...</br></br>
It is often said that there exist another city below Eulice, a huge slum that contrast the beauty of the exterior world, not that anyone cared to verify those rumors.
