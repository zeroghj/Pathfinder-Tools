<h2 class="title">City of Filiyas</h2>
<div class="description">Filiyas is the first city you will come accross if you arrive to the Kingdom of Eulice from the Kingdom of Marns. The city is what most could consider ordinary, albeit very populous. Its major attraction is the huge bridge that connect the two side of the Doom river. The bridge is over 10 km long and made purely from magic. It is said that it takes 100 mages to work on it daily in order to have enough mana to keep it functional, it is quite the experience to walk on such a magical wonder.
