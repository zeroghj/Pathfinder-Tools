<h2 class="title">Gnome City</h2>
<div class="description">Gnomes are known to wander the continent and live in human settlements occasionally, but there is one place they can all call home, and this is Gnome City. For all their ingenuity, Gnome lack the ability to name things very originaly, hence the name of the city. Not many people go to gnome city because it is so difficult to reach, being in the enchanted forest.</br>
The city is filled to the brim with gnomes and all their inventions, it is both marvelous to see what gnome society is capable to accomplish with their ingenuity, but also dangerous since there are frequently explosions and malfunctioning equipment lying around. It may be difficult to stay a long time in Gnome City, there is a definitive culture shock to be had when entering within it.
