<h2 class="title">Nest Grepair</h2>
<div class="description">Grepair is a Tengu's Nest that is the friendliest on the continent. This does not mean that they will welcome you with open arms (and wings), but they are the least likely to kill you on sight. If you seem promising they might take into considering letting you in for the night and trading with you for some interesting goods. Do not expect your stay to be similar to sleeping at an inn in the human kingdoms, the rules are different in this part of the world.
