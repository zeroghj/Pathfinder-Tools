<h2 class="title">Island City of Intla</h2>
<div class="description">Intla is off the coast and only accessible by ship. It is both a resort town and a fishing town. Locals fish for the rare white crabs and can make a fortune living in Intla, but because it is off the coast, it is not as protected than other cities of the Kingdom of Fandor and pirate attack are frequent.
