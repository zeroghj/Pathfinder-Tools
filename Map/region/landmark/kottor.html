<h2 class="title">Kottor</h2>
<div class="description">Kottor is a dwarf fortress city that can be entered from the North of the Rannikkyo region, the city serves mostly as a trade passage way to reach the region of Rannikkyo from Central Fandor. You can see mercenaries and merchant walking through the city daily trying to reach opportunities in the freecity fo Amantora.</br>
While there is no doubt Kottor is a major dwarven city, it is often seen only as "the other end of the tunnel" and despite its large population, the city is not considered to be very important to outsiders. There are a lot of crimes in the city because it function as a highway for trade and despite dwarven guard patrolling it, you need to be careful not to lose your cargo to some thieves.
