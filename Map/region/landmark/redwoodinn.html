<h2 class="title">Redwood Inn</h2>
<div class="description">The Redwood Inn is a notorious stop for travelers as it is the only construction that has been allowed to be built in the Metzan Forest by the Elves guarding it. It is unknown how the deal came to be, but the Inn is situated right in the middle of the forest, on a trade route that runs between Central Fandor to the north and the Kingdom of Marns to the south. The Inn is frequented by every traveller who walk that route and you can find all manner of people taking a stay for the night in the long road through the forest. It is also known to have excellent meals.</br>
