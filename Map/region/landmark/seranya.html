<h2 class="title">City of Seranya</h2>
<div class="description">The city of Seranya is part of the Kingdom of Fandor and it is just as populous as the capital. It is located on the side of the great lake Tsundalis and it is considered to be a city just as important as the capital itself. The city is proporous, but in recent years, the war with the nearby Orc Stronghold has transformed the life in Seranya. Now there are makeshift walls around the city in case of siege and a large portion of the nation army stands in the city to restock before being sent to battle. While no attack as been made on the city itself as of yet, the state of battle can be notice when walking through the street, where woundeds are waiting in line at the apocathery or smith are working overtime to make enough sword for every soldier.
