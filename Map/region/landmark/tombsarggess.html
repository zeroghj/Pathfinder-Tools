<h2 class="title">Tomb of Sarggess</h2>
<div class="description">Sarggess was a powerful necromancer who helped the Great Demon Baltzar in creating what is now known as the wasteland. The necromancer was hated by all living creature on the continent and when he was finally defeated, 400 years ago, his body was burried and sealed in this tomb. The tomb is protected by magic to avoid any kind of spell which could possibly bring back Sarggess from the dead.</br>
400 years later, the tomb has been left to abandon, there are monster inhabiting it and no one seems to care if the magical protection still holds or not.
