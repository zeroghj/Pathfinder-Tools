<div class="description">Tontaron is the dwarven capital of the Kingdom of Tontar and it is a majestic city that really showcase dwarven craftmenship at its best. The city is located near Central Fandor and it acts as an entrance to the passageway for travellers to reach Rannikkyo and more often then not, the free city of Amantora. The Capital is grandiose in size and lively night and day. While there is very little mining done around the city anymore, it still flourish from the travellers and you can always find a dwarven brawl somewhere in the city, no matter the time of the day.</br>
