<h2 class="title">Tozkan</h2>
<div class="description">Tozkan is different than the other dwarven cities of the Kingdom of Tontar, it does not focus on trade or mining. The city is bordering the Metzan Forest and focus on lumber. The Dwarves of Tozkan go to the forest to gather wood for the kingdom, this creates a lot of tension with the elves living in the forest. As such, Tozkan has become a military fortress, it acts as a frontline base for the war between the Elves and the Dwarf for the forest.</br>
