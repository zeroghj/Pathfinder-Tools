<h2 class="title">Village of Zelanda</h2>
<div class="description">Zelanda is a nice little halfling town on the edge of the world. It is a friendly community that is very accepting of strangers and adventurers, they always love to hear the stories of those who wander  the lands and will offer you a pint of beer to come and join them at their table to tell your adventures. They can't offer much in term of armor and weapons, but at least they can provide you with a warm bed, food and ale.</br>
Zelanda is one of the only place on the continent where you will find Halflings, they are a very uncommon sight on the continent and travellers tells story of how much they learned about different philosophy in life by visiting Zelanda.
