<div class="imagedescription">The Metzan Forest is at the heart of the continent and it is the greatest forest on it. The Wood Elves of Metzan lives in it and defend the forest from any danger, keeping it strong and alive. There is very little civilization in those vast woods, nature reigns in this part of the continent.</br>
Being at the heart of the continent, Metzan is surrounded by many region: <a href="marns.html">The Kingdom of Marns</a> to the south, <a href="rannikkyo.html">Rannikkyo</a> to the South-East,<a href="tontarrian.html">The Tontarrian Mountains</a> to the East,<a href="northernfandor.html">Northern</a> and <a href="centralfandor.html"> Central Fandor</a> to the North, <a  href="mtdoom.html">Mt.Doom</a> and <a  href="eulyssia.html">Eulyssia Lake</a> to the West and finaly the <a href="enchantedforest.html">Enchanted Forest</a> to the North-West.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>Only a single "city" resides in the Metzan Forest. It is the largest Elven city on the continent, it is situated on a giant tree in the middle of the forest. Llanossa is a very peaceful city to everyone who embraces nature...and the worst place on the planet for those who opposes it. It is hidden deep into the wood and can be difficult to find.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
The Metzan Forest is filled with trees and very little is known of the forest. The only true landmark is the Redwood Inn, a resting place for travellers who are traversing the forest on the road between <a href="centralfandor.html">Central Fandor</a> and the <a href="marns.html">Kingdom of Marns</a>. There is also a rumour of an ancient gnome hideout filled with gnomish treasure somewhere in the eastern forest, but no one knows where it would be.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
The Metzan forest is a ...forest. Most of the land as very little elevation, there are no major roads, the climate is temperate. Between one large tree to another, it is very easy to get lost in here.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
The wildlife in the Metzan forest is rather peaceful in general. The forest is large and has enough ressources for every animal, making competition for ressources limited and therefore it is rare that a savage beast will come hunting after you. The elf are the greatest threat if they consider you an enemy of nature, otherwise you are more likely to get lost than killed in this gigantic region.
