Landmark:</br>
Rannikkyo is known to have a very cold cave that adventure loves to visit, but very little is known about it. It also has a very big Troll Camp in its region, but no one dares adventure near it.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
Rannikkyo is a temperate region that receives a lot of rain and has great many rivers thanks to the nearby <a href="tontarrian.html">Tontarrian Mountains<a>. It rains quite often in the region and the vegetation is very lush and thick. It is difficult to travel the forests both because of their density and of the wildlife living in it. The region has great many rivers, but there are no bridge to cross any of them or no road to orient yourself when travelling. Rannikkyo is fairly safe from wars and conflict of the continent since it is very isolated.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
Rannikkyo has a very active and dangerous wildlife, the forests are filled with strong beasts and if it were not enough, goblins and troll roams its land. The northern part of the land is even more dangerous as some undead and demon can sometime make their way past the <a href="wasteland.html">Wasteland</a> and the <a href="deadforest.html">Dead Forest</a> to the northen region of Rannikkyo.
