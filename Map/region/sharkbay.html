<div class="imagedescription">Shark's Bay is a region known for one place in particular, the Bay that has the form of a shark and which is actually filled with Sharks too. The region is part of no kingdom and all cities and locations are independent of each other.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br><a href="landmark/sharktown.html">Sharktown</a> is the most well known city in the region, it is a pirate and bandit hideout. There are also two other town in the region though, the Barbarian town of <a href="landmark/branton.html">Branton</a> and the magical community known as the <a href="landmark/magiccollege.html">College of Magic</a></br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
Other than the geographical landmark that constitute Shark's Bay, the one landmark in the area is the Mages Tower that stand on top of a magically formed mountain. It is known that the mountain has high magical power and it is rumored that mages study special kind of magic and do weird experiments up in that tower, but it is very difficult to enter as you need to use a portal kept by the mages to reach it.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
Shark's Bay is mostly grassland and forest. It is temperate but not as fertile as other region of the continent. The Cliff near the Bay are over 40 meters high, but they are replaced by beautiful beaches if you go closer to the southern region.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
The Wildlife in the region is tough, everything seems bigger than elsewhere on the continent, from the bees to the boars. It makes it difficult for outsiders to adapt since suddenly a single wolf can become a real threat. There are also a lot of weird magical monsters near the Mages Tower and it goes without saying that the Bay is filled with Sharks and other marine monsters. It is not an easy life.
