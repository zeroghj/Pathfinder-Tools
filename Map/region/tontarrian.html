Landmark:</br>
Marns has very little landmark, it is a very boring and peaceful kingdom.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
The Kingdom of Marns is located on the southern part of the Continent and it spreads along the souther coast. The coast has long and beautiful beaches on its western part, while the eastern part of Marns has cliffs and abrupt drop between the land and the ocean. Most of Marns is made of steep cliffs, hills and rivers. The temperature is quite stable and temperate, never too cold, never too hot. There are some forest here and there and a few lakes, but they are not as common as the endless abrupt grassland of the region.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
There is a lot of wildlife in the region, the higher you go in the hills and the more north you go, the higher the chance that you will encounter some wild beasts and the like. It is also known that goblins reside in the hills. The coasts are mostly clear of foes, only on the western part of the region can you run into trouble, since Nagas and Harpies tend to roam the area.
