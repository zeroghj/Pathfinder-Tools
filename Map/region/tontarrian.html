<div class="imagedescription">The Tontarrian Mountains are homes to the largest dwarven kingdom. The Kingdom of Tontar is built in the mountains and has a network of mines and cities within it. The Tontarrian Mountains are so tall that some says the air elementals cannot even reach its highest peak, the mountains are treacherous to climb and therefore not many people travels there. The Tontarrian mountains are surrounded by the <a href="rannikkyo.html">Rannikkyo region</a> to the East and South, West lies the <a href="metzan.html">Metzan Forest</a> and <a href="centralfandor.html">Central Fandor</a> while North you can find the <a href="deadforest.html">Dead Forest</a>.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>The Tontarrian Mountains is the domain of the dwarves, the Kingdom of Tontar spread under the mountains and there are four main dwarven fortress that gives entrance to the kingdom. The Capital, <a href="landmark/tontaron.html">Tontaron</a></br> is the most populous dwarven city on the continent. <a href="landmark/tozkan.html">Tozkan</a>, <a href="landmark/kottor.html">Kottor</a> and <a href="landmark/zendan.html">Zendan</a> are the three other fortress cities that gives entrance to the dwarven kingdom.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
The Tontarrian Mountains themselves could be considered a landmark of the land, their highest peak reaches above the clouds and it is known that the tontarrian lake reside at the top of the mountain, the lake provides most of the water for the lush regions around it and the few who have seen it claims it to be a sight to behold. Otherwise, the <a href="landmark/kordanmine.html">Kordan's Mines</a> are a famous adventurer hotspot, those ancients dwarven mines have been abandonned centuries ago and they are still full of gold...and monsters. </br>
Another important landmark is the <a href="landmark/tombsarggess.html">Tomb of Sarggess</a>, the ancient tomb contains the treasures and remains of a powerful necromancer who roamed the land long ago.</br>
There are also rumors of a hidden cave of wonder at a location called the Hidden Fall. Little is known about its location or what kind of wonders could lie inside. Another famous rumor is that an oasis exists somewhere at the top of the mountains, a place where peaceful wildlife and trees can grow, but no one ever saw it with their own eyes.</br>
</br>
Environment:</br>
The Tontarrian Mountains are a very harsh environment to live in. The Mountains are cold, abrupt and deadly. There are cliffs and avalanche and all kind of natural trap waiting for you if you set to walk or climb the region. The only reason people bother to adventure in the reason is because of the richest beneath the mountain. There are huge deposit of iron, copper and adamantite that form in the mountain and some people adventures in it to find those prized minerals.</br>
If the outside is deadly, the same can be said of the other world beneath the mountains. The dwarves have created a vast network of tunnels under the mountains that connect one side to the other and spawn the entire region, yet most of those tunnels have long collapsed or been abandonned and are now crawling with monsters. The tunnels are really cold and dangerous place and some say that there are even tunnels going so deep into the earth that you can reach lava.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
The Tontarrian Mountains are a very dangerous place to live, only the tough dwarves are strong enough to endure all the monsters coming from both the inside and the outside of the mountain. The mountains are a harsh environment, meaning only the strongest of wildlife is able to adapt and survive there and most of it is very hostile. If the outside is hostile, it usually still looks like puppies compared to the danger lying in wait in the deep dwarven tunnels. Fiends, Crawlers and Undeads have all taken refuges in the dark abandonned tunnels. It is a dangerous place to be.
