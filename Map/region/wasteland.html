<div class="imagedescription">The Wasteland used to be the center of a Human Kingdom long ago. It was a fertile land where both Orc and Humans were competing for ressources and had built major settlements. 500 years ago, a powerful wizard created a portal that opened up to the demon realm. Powerful demons began entering the land and destroyed both Humans and Orc in the region. If it was not enough, a powerful demon eventually came through the portal and with the help of a powerful necromancer, he cursed the land around him. Even after 500 years, the curse is still present and the land has been corrupted beyond saving, the region has henceforth been known as the Wasteland.</br>
</br>
Cities: </br>There are many ruins of cities and stronghold in the region, don't expect any dinner there anytime soon though. The tallest buildings have all fallen to the grounds, some house barely have half a wall standing somewhere. The land has been conquered by demons and undead for centuries and there is very little thing of interest left to be seen. Those cities are now filled with monsters and not the civilized kind. The cities are now landmarks more than anything else.</br>
</br>
Landmark:</br>
There are a couple of important location in the wasteland, first is the Great Cemetary. It used to be a peaceful ground where those who passed could rest in peace, but after the event of 500 years ago, the cemetary is now hell on earth. The dead have all risen and walk the land, trying to kill what ever they come in contact with. It is the land of the dead and anything that dies in the Wasteland only comes back alive as an undead right afterwards.</br>
Another important location is the Monastery of the Dead, ironically enough, this use to be a great Monastery to promote life and peace, after the portal opening and the destruction of the Kingdom, it was turned into something completely different. Some dark cultist and Necromancer run the place and pray to the God of Death while making sacrifice of whoever they could get their hands on.</br>
The last and most important landmark of the Wasteland is without doubt the <a href="landmark/demonportal.html">Demon Portal</a> itself. It is situated in the center between the wasteland and the dead forest and while not active anymore, it remains surrounded by vile creatures.
</br>
Environment:</br>
The Wasteland is a peculiar place, for the ground itself is like nothing you could have seen in this world. It is dark, radiating a purple hue and anyone walking on it feels nauseous and dizzy. There is a putrid smell to the region, you feel your body starts to rot faster and there is not a living thing in sight. There is a suspicious fume coming out of the ground sometimes and it makes it difficult to see properly and create mirages and illusions in the distance. Sometimes you can find the carcass of a dead fiend on the ground, mauled by some devilish beast and hear terrible sounds in the distance without being able to properly locate where it comes from. It is hell.</br>
</br>
Wildlife and Monsters:</br>
There is no wildlife here, only monsters. Devils, Hell spawns, undead and Demons if you are unlucky. Do not go into the wasteland, it is a death sentence.
